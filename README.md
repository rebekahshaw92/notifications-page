### What I Learned 

While doing this project I got the chance to continue vorking with Bootstrap 5 and jQuery. As it had been a while since I had worked with jQuery I had to refesh my memory as to how change the background colour of an element when a link is clicked.

### Continued Development

I would like to continued working both with Bootstrap 5 and jQuery.

### Userful Resources 

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) - This site helped me learn all I needed to know about Bootstrap.
